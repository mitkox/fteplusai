# Operations & Monitoring Plan

**Goal:** Maintain reliability, cost control, and quality for local AI usage.

## Monitoring

- [ ] Usage dashboards (requests, users, latency)
- [ ] Cost dashboards (compute, storage)
- [ ] Quality metrics (pass rate, defect leakage)
- [ ] Model drift indicators
- [ ] System health (CPU/GPU, queue depth)

## Cost Controls

- [ ] Budget thresholds and alerts
- [ ] Usage caps by team or role
- [ ] Off-peak scheduling for heavy jobs
- [ ] Model selection policy by task criticality

## Quality Gates

- [ ] Human review required for high-risk outputs
- [ ] Regression tests for automated changes
- [ ] Approved prompt templates for critical workflows

## Support & Escalation

- Tier 1: Internal help desk
- Tier 2: Platform/ML ops team
- Tier 3: Vendor or platform support

## Maintenance

- Weekly model performance reviews
- Monthly capacity planning
- Quarterly access reviews
