# Document Structure Skill

## Overview
This skill provides expertise in organizing complex technical documentation with clear hierarchies, logical flow, and intuitive navigation for R&D audiences.

## Key Capabilities

### Information Architecture
- Create logical document hierarchies (H1-H6 heading structure)
- Organize content from high-level concepts to detailed implementations
- Group related topics and create clear content sections
- Design table of contents and navigation structures

### Document Types
**Strategic Documents:**
- Executive summaries and business cases
- ROI analysis and cost-benefit comparisons
- Vendor replacement roadmaps
- AI adoption strategies

**Technical Documents:**
- Implementation guides and tutorials
- API documentation
- Architecture diagrams and system designs
- Integration specifications

**Process Documents:**
- Workflow documentation
- Standard operating procedures (SOPs)
- Decision frameworks and evaluation matrices
- Checklists and templates

### Structural Patterns

#### For Getting Started Guides:
```
1. Overview (What is it?)
2. Prerequisites
3. Quick Start (Minimal viable setup)
4. Core Concepts
5. Step-by-Step Tutorial
6. Common Issues & Troubleshooting
7. Next Steps
```

#### For Comparison Documents:
```
1. Context & Need
2. Evaluation Criteria
3. Options Overview Table
4. Detailed Comparisons
5. Decision Matrix
6. Recommendations
7. Implementation Path
```

#### For Technical Specifications:
```
1. Purpose & Scope
2. System Overview
3. Architecture
4. Components/Modules
5. APIs & Interfaces
6. Data Models
7. Security Considerations
8. Performance Requirements
```

### Best Practices
- Use progressive disclosure (simple to complex)
- Maintain consistent heading levels
- Include cross-references between related sections
- Add visual breaks with tables, lists, and code blocks
- Keep paragraphs short (3-5 sentences max)
- Use descriptive headings that answer questions
- Include "TL;DR" or executive summaries for long sections

### Document Templates

#### Section Template:
```markdown
## [Section Title] (Clear, Action-Oriented)

**Context:** Brief explanation of why this matters

**Key Points:**
- Main point 1
- Main point 2
- Main point 3

**Implementation:**
[Step-by-step instructions or code examples]

**Considerations:**
- Important note 1
- Important note 2

**Related:** [Links to related sections]
```

### Navigation Helpers
- Use anchor links for long documents
- Create "Back to top" links for extended sections
- Include breadcrumb-style navigation in headers
- Add "See also" sections for related content
- Maintain a glossary for terminology

## Output Format
- Clear markdown with proper heading hierarchy
- Consistent spacing (2 blank lines before H2, 1 before H3-H6)
- Logical progression of ideas
- Scannable structure with visual hierarchy
