```markdown
## Power-Interest Grid

               High Power
                   |
     KEEP SATISFIED | MANAGE CLOSELY
    ┌──────────────┼──────────────┐
    │  CFO         │  CTO         │
    │  Legal       │  R&D VP      │
    │  Procurement │  Exec Sponsor│ High
    ├──────────────┼──────────────┤ Interest
    │  Other VPs   │  Dev Teams   │
    │  HR          │  Tool Vendors│
    │  Comms       │  Pilot Team  │
    └──────────────┴──────────────┘
      MONITOR      │ KEEP INFORMED
                   |
               Low Power

**Quadrant Strategies:**

**Manage Closely (High Power, High Interest):**

- Example: CTO, R&D VP, Executive Sponsor

**Keep Satisfied (High Power, Low Interest):**
- Monthly executive summaries

- Respect their time
- Example: CFO, other C-suite

**Keep Informed (Low Power, High Interest):**
- Regular team communications
- Involve in planning
- Quick response to questions
- Community building
- Example: Dev teams, pilot team members

**Monitor (Low Power, Low Interest):**
- General updates only
- Available if needed
- No active engagement
- Example: Adjacent teams, observers
```

### Stakeholder Register

### Communication Planning

**Communication Matrix:**
```markdown

|----------|---------|-----------|--------|-------|---------|
| Executive Sponsor | Decisions, escalations | Weekly | 1:1 meeting | PM | Status, risks, decisions needed |
| Steering Committee | Governance, approval | Monthly | Meeting | PM | Strategic updates, phase gates |
| Program Team | Coordination | Daily | Standup | PM | Tasks, blockers, coordination |
| Pilot Team | Guidance, support | 2x/week | Office hours | Change Mgr | Training, Q&A, feedback |

```

**Message Development Framework:**

**SCQA Structure (Situation-Complication-Question-Answer):**
```markdown
**Situation:** Current state or context
"We're currently spending $400K/year on offshore development vendors"

**Complication:** Problem or opportunity
"Costs are rising 10%/year and we're losing IP and flexibility"

**Question:** What the audience is wondering
"How can we reduce costs while maintaining quality?"

**Answer:** Your recommendation or update
"We're piloting AI-augmented FTEs to reduce costs 60% in 90 days"

**Apply to each communication based on audience priorities**
```

## Resistance Management

### Sources of Resistance

**Job Security Fears:**
- Concern: "AI will replace me"
- Reality: AI augments, transforms roles
- Response: Career development, upskilling, role evolution

**Change Fatigue:**
- Concern: "Another transformation initiative"
- Reality: This one has clear ROI and timeline
- Response: Acknowledge past, show differences, quick wins

**Loss of Control:**
- Concern: "This is being forced on me"
- Reality: Need to adapt to market changes
- Response: Involve in decisions, allow input, phased adoption

**Competency Anxiety:**
- Concern: "I don't know how to use AI"
- Reality: New skill, but learnable
- Response: Training, support, mentoring, practice time

**Quality Concerns:**
- Concern: "AI output isn't good enough"
- Reality: AI + human = better than either alone
- Response: Data, validation processes, pilot proof

**Vendor Relationship:**
- Concern: "We have good relationship with vendor"
- Reality: Business decision, not personal
- Response: Professional transition, maintain relationships

### Resistance Response Playbook

**Step 1: Listen and Validate**
```markdown
**Bad:** "Your concern is unfounded"
**Good:** "I hear your concern about [X]. That's important. Tell me more about that."

**Goal:** Understand root cause, show respect, build trust
**Time:** 70% listening, 30% talking
```

**Step 2: Acknowledge and Empathize**
```markdown
**Bad:** "Get over it"
**Good:** "I understand why you'd feel that way. Change is hard, especially when..."

**Goal:** Show empathy, build connection
**Avoid:** Dismissing, minimizing, arguing
```

**Step 3: Provide Context and Data**
```markdown
**Bad:** "Just trust us"
**Good:** "Here's why we're doing this... [business case]. Here's what we've seen... [data]."

**Goal:** Build understanding, address information gaps
**Include:** ROI, market trends, competitor actions, success stories
```

**Step 4: Address Specific Concerns**
```markdown
**Bad:** Generic talking points
**Good:** Direct response to their specific concern with concrete actions

Example:
Concern: "I'll lose my job"
Response: "No layoffs planned. In fact, we're investing $19K in training to upskill the team. Your role will evolve to higher-value architecture work. Here's the career path..."
```

**Step 5: Offer Involvement**
```markdown
**Bad:** "This is happening whether you like it or not"
**Good:** "Would you like to be part of the pilot? Your feedback would be valuable. What would make this work better for you?"

**Goal:** Create ownership, allow input
**Result:** Resister → Skeptic → Neutral → Supporter
```

### Difficult Conversations

**Preparation:**
- Know your facts and data
- Anticipate objections
- Prepare responses

**Follow-up:**

3. How confident are you in program success?
   1 (Not confident) - 5 (Very confident)

   [Open text]

**Target: Average ≥4.0/5.0**
```

**Feedback Channels:**

- Office hours (open door)
- Anonymous feedback (suggestion box)
- Retrospectives (team)
- 1:1 meetings (individual)

## Common Stakeholder Management Pitfalls

### Pitfall 1: Ignoring Low-Power Stakeholders
**Problem:** Focusing only on executives, ignoring team members
**Why it fails:** Team resistance sinks programs despite executive support
**Solution:** Engage all levels, especially those doing the work

### Pitfall 2: One-Way Communication
**Problem:** Talking at stakeholders, not listening
**Why it fails:** Miss concerns, lose support, create resistance
**Solution:** 70% listening, 30% talking. Ask questions.

### Pitfall 3: Surprising Stakeholders
**Problem:** Springing major changes or issues without warning
**Why it fails:** Erodes trust, creates defensive reactions
**Solution:** No surprises. Communicate early and often.

### Pitfall 4: Treating All Stakeholders the Same
**Problem:** Same message, same frequency for everyone
**Why it fails:** Doesn't match needs, wastes time or under-informs
**Solution:** Tailor approach based on power-interest analysis

### Pitfall 5: Avoiding Difficult Stakeholders
**Problem:** Not engaging with resisters or skeptics
**Why it fails:** Problems fester, resistance grows, sabotage risk
**Solution:** Engage early, often, and directly
