**Important:** This documentation is for informational purposes only and does not constitute legal advice. Organizations should consult with qualified legal counsel for specific contract negotiations, compliance requirements, and legal matters.

## Contract Fundamentals

### Key Contract Terms

**Material Terms to Review:**

| Term | Definition | Risk Level | Key Considerations |
|------|------------|------------|-------------------|
| **Term & Termination** | Duration and exit rights | High | Notice periods, penalties, auto-renewal |
| **Data Rights** | Ownership of data | High | Who owns inputs, outputs, derivatives |
| **IP Ownership** | Intellectual property | High | Code ownership, AI-generated content |
| **Liability** | Risk allocation | High | Caps, exclusions, indemnification |
| **SLA** | Service commitments | Medium | Uptime, performance, remedies |
| **Confidentiality** | Data protection | Medium | Scope, duration, exclusions |
| **Pricing** | Cost structure | Medium | Fixed vs. usage, increases, hidden fees |

### Contract Review Workflow

```markdown
## Contract Review Process

### Phase 1: Initial Assessment (1-2 days)
1. Identify contract type (SaaS, services, license)
2. Determine applicable laws and jurisdiction
3. List all parties and their roles
4. Identify key stakeholders for review
5. Note contract term and renewal provisions

### Phase 2: Detailed Review (3-5 days)
1. Data and privacy provisions
2. Intellectual property clauses
3. Service levels and performance
4. Termination and exit rights
5. Liability and indemnification
6. Pricing and payment terms
7. Change and amendment provisions

### Phase 3: Risk Assessment (1-2 days)
1. Document identified risks
2. Score risks by likelihood and impact
3. Prioritize risks for negotiation
4. Develop mitigation strategies
5. Prepare negotiation points

### Phase 4: Negotiation (Variable)
1. Present priority issues to vendor
2. Propose alternative language
3. Document all agreed changes
4. Obtain legal review of final terms
5. Execute with proper authorization
```

## Intellectual Property

### IP Ownership Analysis

**AI-Generated Content Ownership:**

```markdown
## IP Ownership Framework

### Input Ownership
- Customer-provided code: Customer owns
- Customer prompts: Customer owns
- Customer data: Customer owns
- Training data: Depends on agreement

### Output Ownership
**Key Question:** Who owns AI-generated code/content?

**Preferred Position (Customer):**
- Customer owns all outputs generated from customer inputs
- No vendor rights to use, train, or improve from customer data
- Clear assignment of any derivative works

**Vendor Position (Watch For):**
- Vendor retains rights to outputs for improvement
- Vendor may use aggregated/anonymized data
- License grant rather than ownership transfer

### Contract Language Examples

**Favorable (Customer Owns):**
"All outputs generated by the Service using Customer Data
shall be owned exclusively by Customer. Vendor disclaims
any rights, title, or interest in such outputs."

**Unfavorable (Review Carefully):**
"Vendor retains all rights to improvements, modifications,
and derivative works created using or derived from the
Service, including those incorporating Customer Data."
```

### Open Source Compliance

```markdown
## Open Source License Considerations

### License Categories

**Permissive Licenses (Lower Risk):**
- MIT License
- Apache 2.0
- BSD 2-Clause/3-Clause

Requirements: Attribution, license notice
Allows: Commercial use, modification, distribution

**Copyleft Licenses (Higher Complexity):**
- GPL v2/v3
- LGPL
- AGPL

Requirements: Source disclosure, same license
Risk: "Viral" effect on combined works

### Compliance Checklist

- [ ] Inventory all open source components
- [ ] Document license for each component
- [ ] Verify license compatibility with use case
- [ ] Maintain required attributions
- [ ] Implement source availability if required
- [ ] Review AI tool's open source dependencies
- [ ] Check AI output for licensed content
```
