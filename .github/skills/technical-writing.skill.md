# Technical Writing Skill

## Overview
This skill ensures clear, concise, and effective technical communication for R&D audiences with varying levels of AI expertise.

## Core Principles

### Clarity Over Cleverness
- Use simple, direct language
- Avoid jargon unless necessary (and define it when used)
- Write at an appropriate reading level (aim for grade 10-12)
- One main idea per sentence
- Active voice over passive voice

### Writing Style Guidelines

**DO:**
- "Click the Deploy button" ✓
- "The system processes data in real-time" ✓
- "This reduces costs by 40%" ✓
- "Follow these steps to configure..." ✓

**DON'T:**
- "Utilize the deployment functionality" ✗
- "Data is processed by the system" ✗
- "Cost optimization is achieved" ✗
- "The configuration process involves..." ✗

### Sentence Structure
- **Short sentences:** 15-20 words average
- **Varied length:** Mix short and medium sentences
- **Parallel structure:** Keep lists consistent
- **Avoid nested clauses:** Break complex sentences into multiple simple ones

**Example:**
❌ "The AI agent, which was developed to automate code reviews, can be configured by users who have administrator privileges to examine pull requests that meet specific criteria defined in the settings."

✓ "The AI agent automates code reviews. Administrators can configure it to examine pull requests. The agent uses criteria defined in the settings."

### Technical Accuracy
- Verify all technical claims
- Include version numbers for tools and platforms
- Provide accurate code examples that execute correctly
- Cite sources for statistics and claims
- Use precise terminology consistently

### Audience Adaptation

**For Executives:**
- Focus on business value and ROI
- Use high-level summaries
- Include financial metrics
- Minimize technical jargon

**For R&D Managers:**
- Balance technical and business content
- Include implementation timelines

- Provide risk assessments

**For Developers:**
- Provide detailed technical specifications
- Include code examples
- Reference API documentation
- Explain architecture decisions

**For Stakeholders:**
- Focus on outcomes and impact
- Use analogies and examples
- Address concerns and risks
- Provide clear action items

### Common Writing Patterns

#### Explaining Concepts:
```
1. Define it (What is it?)

3. Show it (Provide examples)
4. Apply it (How to use it)
```

#### Giving Instructions:
```
1. State the goal
2. List prerequisites
3. Number steps sequentially
4. Use imperative mood ("Click", "Enter", "Select")
5. Include expected outcomes
```

#### Comparing Options:
```
1. Establish criteria
2. Present options neutrally
3. Show trade-offs
4. Provide recommendations based on use cases
```
