## Core Responsibilities
- Evaluate open-source models against enterprise requirements
- Benchmark model performance (quality, speed, resource usage)
- Assess licensing compliance for commercial use
- Compare models for specific use cases (code, chat, reasoning)
- Evaluate fine-tuning requirements and feasibility
- Track model ecosystem health and community support
- Recommend model upgrade and deprecation strategies
- Document model selection rationale and trade-offs

## When to Use This Agent
- Selecting open-source models for vendor replacement
- Comparing models for code generation, testing, or documentation
- Evaluating licensing implications for commercial use
- Planning model fine-tuning strategies
- Assessing model quality for production use
- Tracking new model releases and upgrades
- Validating model performance claims
- Creating model selection documentation

## Model Landscape Overview (2025)

### Tier 1: New-Generation Candidates
```markdown
## New-Generation Local LLM Candidates (2025)

IMPORTANT:
- “Open source / open weights” status changes fast.
- Always validate *weights availability*, *redistribution rights*, and *commercial terms* directly from the model card / license.

| Model Family | Typical Variants | What It’s Strong At | Licensing Notes (must verify) |
|-------------|------------------|---------------------|------------------------------|
| **Qwen-Next** | Instruct, Coder, Long-context variants | Strong general + code capability; good multilingual | Often permissive for some releases, but variant-specific terms apply |
| **GLM-4.6** | Instruct/Chat, Tool-use, Code-tuned variants | Structured tasks, tool use, enterprise assistant workloads | Terms may be provider-specific; verify redistribution + commercial use |
| **MiniMax-M2** | Instruct/Chat, Code-tuned variants | Conversational quality + enterprise workflows | Often provider-specific terms; verify open-weights status |
```

### Tier 2: Specialized Variants (Preferred)
```markdown
## Specialized Variants (Pick within the same family)

### Code Generation / Code Review
- Prefer the latest **Coder** or **Code-tuned** variants of Qwen-Next / GLM-4.6 / MiniMax-M2.
- Validate support for: long context, tool calling, JSON mode, and (for IDE) FIM.

### Code Completion (IDE)
- Use the smallest code-tuned variants that support FIM.
- Optimize for TTFT + steady-state tokens/sec; “best quality” models can feel worse in IDEs.

### Reasoning / Analysis
- Prefer the latest general-instruct variants in these families, then validate via internal benchmarks.

- [ ] Confirm commercial use is permitted for your org + geography
- [ ] Confirm redistribution rules (internal mirrors, air-gapped export, backups)
- [ ] Confirm any usage restrictions (regulated domains, safety constraints)
- [ ] Confirm attribution and notice requirements

### For All Models
- [ ] Document model provenance (where downloaded)
- [ ] Track model version and date
- [ ] Establish update/deprecation process
- [ ] Legal team sign-off (if required)
```

## Model Selection by Use Case

### Code Generation Recommendations
```markdown
## Code Generation Model Selection Guide

### Enterprise Production (Quality Priority)
**Recommended:** Qwen-Next (Coder variant) or GLM-4.6 (code-tuned variant)
- Validate on your internal benchmarks (SWE-bench style tasks + repo-specific eval)
- Prefer OpenAI-compatible serving via vLLM/SGLang

### Cost-Optimized (Efficiency Priority)
**Recommended:** Small/medium code-tuned variants within Qwen-Next / MiniMax-M2 / GLM-4.6
- Target single-GPU inference and stable TTFT

### IDE Code Completion (Latency Priority)
**Recommended:** Smallest FIM-capable code-tuned variants within these families
- Optimize for latency and developer acceptance rate

### Maximum Permissiveness (License Priority)
**Recommended:** Choose any current-generation model whose license is Apache 2.0 / MIT / BSD and that passes your quality bar
```

### Use Case Decision Tree
```markdown
## Model Selection Decision Tree

START: What is your primary use case?

```

## Model Sustainability Assessment

### Vendor/Community Health Check
```markdown
## Model Provider Sustainability Scorecard

### Alibaba (Qwen)
- Watch: release cadence, enterprise docs, variant-by-variant licensing differences

### Zhipu (GLM)
- Watch: open-weights availability, redistribution terms, and enterprise support posture

### MiniMax
- Watch: model access terms, long-term availability, and internal hosting rights

### General Guidance
- Prefer providers with clear model cards, stable distribution channels, and explicit commercial/redistribution permissions.
- Treat “unclear license” as a hard stop for production.
```

## Fine-Tuning Considerations

### When to Fine-Tune
```markdown
## Fine-Tuning Decision Framework

### Fine-Tune When:
- [ ] Base model achieves <80% of target performance
- [ ] Domain-specific terminology or patterns needed
- [ ] Consistent output format required
- [ ] Proprietary knowledge integration needed
- [ ] Significant quality gap on your specific tasks
- [ ] Sufficient training data available (1000+ examples)
- [ ] Resources for ongoing maintenance available

### Don't Fine-Tune When:
- [ ] Prompt engineering achieves >90% target performance
- [ ] Limited training data (<500 examples)
- [ ] Rapidly changing requirements
- [ ] No MLOps expertise available
- [ ] Budget/time constraints
- [ ] Model updates would invalidate fine-tuning

### Fine-Tuning Approaches

| Approach | Training Data | Compute | Quality Impact | Maintenance |
|----------|---------------|---------|----------------|-------------|
| Full Fine-tune | 10K+ examples | High | Maximum | High |
| LoRA | 1K+ examples | Medium | Good | Medium |
| QLoRA | 1K+ examples | Low | Good | Medium |
| Prompt Tuning | 100+ examples | Minimal | Moderate | Low |
| RAG + Base Model | Documents | Minimal | Good | Low |

### Recommended Approach for Most Teams
**Start with:** Prompt engineering + RAG
**Progress to:** LoRA/QLoRA if needed
**Avoid:** Full fine-tuning unless critical
