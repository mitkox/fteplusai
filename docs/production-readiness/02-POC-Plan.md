# POC Plan (Local AI)

**Objective:** Validate local AI stack for code and QA workflows without data leaving the environment.

## Scope

- **Teams:** Dev + QA
- **Duration:** 4 weeks
- **Data:** Use sanitized internal repos and synthetic test data
- **Success Criteria:** Quality, latency, cost, developer satisfaction

## Timeline

### Week 1: Setup
- [ ] Provision local AI infrastructure
- [ ] Configure access controls and logging
- [ ] Install IDE/CI integrations
- [ ] Define success metrics and baselines

### Week 2: Dev Workflows
- [ ] Code completion and refactor tests
- [ ] PR review suggestions
- [ ] Unit test generation
- [ ] Measure latency, accuracy, and adoption

### Week 3: QA Workflows
- [ ] Test case generation
- [ ] Regression test prioritization
- [ ] Bug triage summaries
- [ ] Measure defect leakage and false positives

### Week 4: Evaluation
- [ ] Compare against baseline metrics
- [ ] TCO and ops effort estimates
- [ ] Security/compliance review
- [ ] Go/No-Go recommendation

## Metrics

- **Quality:** Pass rate of generated code/tests
- **Speed:** Average response time and time saved
- **Cost:** Cost per task and projected monthly spend
- **Adoption:** Usage rate and satisfaction survey

## Deliverables

- POC results report
- Updated tool scorecard
- Risk register updates
- Recommendation memo
