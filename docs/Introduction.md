# FTE+AI: 30-60-90 Day Vendor Replacement Program

> **A Complete Program Execution Framework for R&D Leaders**

---

## Executive Overview

The landscape of software R&D is undergoing a fundamental transformation. This isn't a documentation toolkit—it's a **hands-on program execution framework** that guides you through replacing outsourcing vendors with AI-augmented teams in 90 days. Using our proven 30-60-90 day methodology with specialized AI agents, R&D leaders are reducing vendor dependencies, cutting costs by 60-80%, and increasing team productivity by 1.5-2.5x through strategic AI adoption.

**The Bottom Line:** Organizations implementing AI-augmented R&D approaches are achieving payback periods of 3-6 months while retaining critical intellectual property and knowledge internally. This isn't theory—it's happening now across startups, mid-size companies, and enterprises alike.

## The Problem: The Hidden Costs of Vendor Dependency

### The Vendor Trap

R&D organizations have historically relied on outsourcing vendors to address capacity constraints, specialized skill gaps, and cost management. Whether it's offshore development teams, QA contractors, technical writing services, or data annotation specialists, vendors have become a standard part of the R&D ecosystem.

However, this dependency creates significant challenges:

**Financial Drain**
- Vendor costs compound annually with 5-10% rate increases
- Hidden costs include management overhead, communication inefficiencies, and rework
- Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) often exceeds 150% of stated contract values
- Budget unpredictability as project scopes expand

**Knowledge Loss**
- Critical domain knowledge resides with external parties
- Institutional knowledge walks out the door when contracts end
- Reduced innovation capacity as vendors execute rather than innovate
- Documentation gaps and tribal knowledge issues

**Control and Flexibility**
- Slower response to changing priorities and market conditions
- Communication overhead across time zones and organizations
- Quality inconsistencies and alignment challenges
- Limited visibility into actual work being performed

**IP and Security Risks**
- Intellectual property exposed to third parties
- Compliance and security vulnerabilities
- Vendor staff turnover creates continuity risks
- Contractual complications around code ownership

### The Real Numbers

Consider a typical scenario: A mid-size software company employs three offshore developers at $50/hour for development work, supplemented by QA contractors and technical writers. The annual cost breakdown looks like this:

- **Direct vendor costs:** $240,000/year (3 developers × 160 hours/month × $50)
- **Project management overhead:** $30,000/year (internal coordination)
- **Communication and tools:** $20,000/year (meetings, translation, collaboration platforms)
- **Rework and quality issues:** $40,000/year (estimated 15% of deliverables)
- **Contract and legal:** $10,000/year

**Total Annual Cost:** $340,000 for work output equivalent to approximately 3 full-time employees.

And this doesn't account for the opportunity costs of delayed innovation, knowledge loss, or the strategic inflexibility that comes with vendor lock-in.

### The Triggering Moment

Most R&D leaders reach a critical inflection point when they realize:
- Vendor costs are growing faster than revenue
- Critical projects are delayed due to vendor capacity constraints
- Key knowledge has left with departing contractor staff
- Internal teams spend more time managing vendors than building product
- The company's IP and competitive advantage is too exposed

This is where AI presents a transformative alternative.

## The Solution: AI-Augmented FTE Teams

### A Paradigm Shift

Rather than replacing human intelligence with artificial intelligence, the FTE+AI approach **augments** internal full-time employees with AI capabilities that handle routine, repetitive, and time-intensive tasks. This frees your talented engineers, analysts, and researchers to focus on high-value work: architecture, innovation, strategy, and complex problem-solving.

### How It Works

**AI as a Force Multiplier**

Modern AI tools, particularly GitHub Copilot, GPT-4, Claude, and specialized domain models, can now effectively handle tasks that previously required vendor staff:

**Code Generation:** AI assists with boilerplate code, API integrations, test creation, and routine implementations—tasks that once went to offshore developers.

**Code Review:** Automated AI-powered reviews catch common issues, enforce style guidelines, and provide initial feedback before human review—reducing QA contractor needs.

**Documentation:** AI generates technical documentation from code, creates API references, and drafts user guides—replacing technical writing contractors.

**Testing:** AI creates test cases, generates test data, and automates QA scenarios—dramatically reducing testing vendor requirements.

**Data Analysis:** AI analyzes patterns, generates insights, and creates reports—handling work that previously required data analyst contractors.

### The FTE+AI Model

Instead of: **5 internal FTEs + 3 vendor developers + contractors**  
Implement: **5 AI-augmented internal FTEs** (with 1.8-2.5x productivity)

**The result:** Output equivalent to 9-12 traditional FTEs while dramatically reducing costs and retaining all knowledge internally.

## Key Benefits: Why R&D Leaders Are Making the Switch

### 1. Dramatic Cost Reduction (60-80%)

**Financial Impact:**
- Eliminate vendor contract costs ($240K+ annually in typical scenarios)
- Reduce management overhead (20-30% savings in coordination time)
- AI tool costs are 10-15% of equivalent vendor expenses
- Typical payback period: 3-6 months

**Example ROI:**
- **Investment:** $50,000 (setup, training, tools)
- **Annual savings:** $168,000 (after AI tool costs)
- **Year 1 ROI:** 236%
- **3-year value:** $500,000+ net savings

The financial case is compelling even in conservative scenarios. Organizations achieving 1.5x productivity gains (rather than 2x) still see 60%+ cost reductions with sub-6-month payback.

### 2. Exponential Productivity Gains (1.5-2.5x)

AI doesn't just replace vendor capacity—it amplifies your existing team:

**Time Savings by Function:**
- Code generation: 30-40% faster
- Code review: 60% reduction in review time
- Documentation: 70% faster creation
- Bug fixing: 40% faster resolution
- Test creation: 50% time savings

**What This Means:**
A 5-person team with 2x productivity can deliver output equivalent to 10 traditional FTEs. Your team doesn't just maintain velocity—they accelerate while taking on more strategic work.

**Real Example:**
Engineering team at mid-size SaaS company:
- **Before:** 5 FTEs + 3 vendor developers = 8 effective FTEs of output
- **After:** 5 AI-augmented FTEs = 9-10 effective FTEs of output
- **Result:** 25% more capacity, 70% lower costs, 100% knowledge retention

### 3. Knowledge and IP Retention

**Strategic Advantages:**
- All code, architecture decisions, and domain knowledge stay internal
- Institutional knowledge compounds rather than walks out the door
- Reduced onboarding time as AI tools learn from your codebase
- Full ownership and control of intellectual property
- Enhanced security posture with reduced external access

This benefit alone often justifies the investment for organizations with significant IP value.

### 4. Increased Agility and Control

**Operational Benefits:**
- Instant capacity scaling without recruitment or vendor negotiations
- Rapid pivot capability as market conditions change
- Direct oversight and communication (no vendor intermediary)
- Consistent quality aligned with company standards
- Real-time visibility into all work

### 5. Quality and Innovation Improvements

**Unexpected Gains:**
- AI catches common bugs before human review
- Consistent code style and documentation
- More time for architecture and innovation work
- Reduced technical debt as AI helps with refactoring
- Teams empowered to experiment and learn faster

Organizations report that freed-up engineering time gets reinvested into innovation, architecture improvements, and strategic initiatives—compounding the value beyond direct cost savings.

### 6. Competitive Advantage

**Market Positioning:**
- Faster time-to-market for new features
- Ability to maintain quality while moving faster
- Reduced dependency on constrained talent markets
- Attraction and retention of top talent who want to work with cutting-edge tools
- Strategic flexibility to outmaneuver competitors

Early adopters are creating sustainable competitive advantages as they build AI-native R&D cultures while competitors remain mired in vendor management overhead.
