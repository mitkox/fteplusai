### Open Source vs. Commercial Decision
```markdown
## Open Source vs. Commercial AI Decision Framework

### Choose Open Source When:
- [ ] Data sovereignty is paramount (must be local)
- [ ] Cost predictability over time is critical
- [ ] In-house ML/DevOps expertise available
- [ ] Customization/fine-tuning required
- [ ] Avoiding vendor lock-in is strategic priority
- [ ] Regulatory requirements mandate local processing
- [ ] Long-term TCO favors self-hosted

### Choose Commercial When:
- [ ] Fastest time-to-value needed
- [ ] Limited in-house ML expertise
- [ ] Managed service preferred over operations
- [ ] Cutting-edge capabilities required immediately
- [ ] Support and SLAs critical for operations
- [ ] Total cost within budget at scale
- [ ] Compliance certifications needed immediately

### Hybrid Approach
Consider combining:
- Local open source for sensitive operations
- Commercial for non-sensitive, high-volume tasks
- Multi-vendor for resilience and negotiating leverage
