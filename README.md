## Usage Patterns

### Pattern 1: Multi-Agent Collaboration

For comprehensive documentation requiring multiple perspectives:

```
1. @ROI-Calculator Create financial justification for AI adoption
2. @Implementation-Guide Create setup tutorial
3. @Case-Study-Documenter Document pilot program results
4. @Documaster Compile everything into cohesive guide
```

### Pattern 2: Skill-Enhanced Requests

Reference specific skills for focused expertise:

```
@Documaster Using #financial-modeling and #data-visualization,
create an ROI dashboard for executives showing vendor replacement savings
```

### Pattern 3: Iterative Refinement

Build documentation incrementally:

```
1. @Documaster Create outline for "AI Code Review Guide"
2. [Review outline with team]
3. @Documaster Expand section 3 with #code-examples
4. [Review and iterate]
5. @Documaster Finalize with #technical-writing quality check
```

### Pattern 4: Enterprise Readiness Bundle

For production readiness in enterprise environments:

```
1. @Tool-Evaluation-Specialist Create tool evaluation scorecard
2. @Security-Risk-Compliance-Advisor Produce security and compliance checklist
3. @Vendor-Transition-Manager Create transition plan and cutover checklist
4. @Change-Management-Coach Build training and adoption plan
5. @Documaster Compile into executive-ready package
